Advent of code solutions.

## Usage:

Fork the repository and create a branch that you can do your setup on.

```bash
git checkout -b 'setup/axelcarl'
```

Create your own directory inside the year your solving, i.e:

```bash
cd 2024
mkdir axelcarl
cd axelcarl
```

Create a pull request to get your directory into the main repo.

Then continue to make pull requests adding your daily solutions to your own directory.

### Workflow:

When the setup is done, cd into your directory:

```bash
cd 2024/axelcarl
```

Create a branch for the days puzzle:

```bash
git checkout -b 'puzzle/day1'
```

Solve the puzzle and then create a pull request with your solution.

## Guideline:

Your puzzle input should not be included in your commits as to not break terms of service. To make this easier all files including the word `input` will be ignored.
